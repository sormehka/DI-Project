# Python-Codes

These codes written in Python each use a different algorithm described bellow for solving problems.
The description of each problem is explained in the first few lines of code as comment.

Greedy Algorithm:

Divide & Conquer Algorithm: These codes each apply the divide-and-conquer technique to solve various computational problems efficiently by splitting them into several disjoint subproblems, solving them recursively, and then combining their results to get an answer for the initial problem.

Dynamic Programming:
