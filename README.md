# Python-Codes

These codes written in Python each use a different algorithm described bellow for solving problems.
The description of each problem is explained in the first few lines of code as comment.

Greedy Algorithm: These codes each apply greedy strategy to solve various computational problems by repeatedly making the most profitable move to construct a solution. This algorithm is applied for (a) changing money with a minimum number of coins;(b) maximizing the total value of a loot;(c) maximizing revenue in online ad placement;(d) minimizing work while collecting signatures;(e) maximizing the number of prize places in a competition;(f) maximizing salary

Divide & Conquer Algorithm: These codes each apply the divide-and-conquer technique to solve various computational problems efficiently by splitting them into several disjoint subproblems, solving them recursively, and then combining their results to get an answer for the initial problem.
